About Client:

This is an Android App which will work as an client for Stork Data Scheduler. It will hook up to Stork's Web Services (Windows azure) using Rest APIs and then communicate using them. Some of the features its first version will have would be multi-protocol framework for Android OS, REST Api connection, optimizing data transfer info while consuming least resources (thread schedulling , polling interval calc and assumed processing). Planned GUIs for all Stork Components as well as file listing on both server side. 

About Stork :

Stork is a batch scheduler specialized in data placement and data movement, which is based on the concept and ideal of making data placement a first class entity in a distributed computing environment. Stork understands the semantics and characteristics of data placement tasks and implements techniques specific to queuing, scheduling, and optimization of these type of tasks.

Stork acts like an I/O control system (IOCS) between the user applications and the underlying protocols and data storage servers. It provides complete modularity and extendibility. The users can add support for their favorite storage system, data transport protocol, or middleware very easily. If the transfer protocol specified in the job description file fails for some reason, Stork can automatically switch to any alternative protocols available between the same source and destination hosts and complete the transfer.

Stork can interact with higher level planners and workflow managers. This allows the users to schedule both CPU resources and storage resources together. Currently, some implementations of Condor DAGMan and Pegasus come with Stork support.

Development of the Stork Data Scheduler is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through its Strategic Technologies for Cyberinfraastructure (STCI) Program.
